    <h1>Forensic science</h1>
<p class="">Before Islam , there was Christianity and injustice was common, He peace be upon him called the people for three things, tawheed, mission and booms day, 
and we have to make the justice is a public able.
	Now which method to taken to make justice public able?  we have to use court and witnesses method. Eye witnesses evidences etc. 
	In order to achieve justice other methods can be used besides witnesses.</p>

	<h3 class="masood">sohail</h3>
	 <p>For example in the holly Quran it’s self in the surah e Yousef
	 “the child testified that if the shirt of Yusuf is torn from back then Yusuf is true, and if its shirt torn from the front, then Zulekha is true.”
	  Similarly, when the sons of hazrat yaqoob (peace be upon him) came to him with the news that his son’s had been eaten by a wolf,
	   he said that it was very strange wolf that he eat my son but left his shirt. </p>
	<p>In an old time a farmer killed another person with a sickle, so people went toward the elder man of the village for justice. The elder man order to collect all of the
	sickles and be kept in front of him.then he picked up a sickle and said its owner is a murderer. The people were very surprised and they asked “how did you knew the murderer”?
	 Then he reply that the bee had only landed on his sickle than the other. Even it was washed of but the effects of the blood still remain.</p>

	<p>Similarly, fingerprints which the criminal leaves somewhere, are enough to identify. Similarly, if we found a dead body in water, that also known that he died by drowning 
	in the water or someone hit him and threw him into the water. If water comes out of his stomach then he is dead in water, and if no water comes out then he has been killed
	 by someone else.  Similarly, the criminal can be identified through blood group. </p>

	<p>But in all these methods there is a doubt that the real criminal is someone else. So machines have been invented to remove the doubt and clearly identify the criminal because
	 the real criminal can be identify by machine, and there is no room for doubt.</p>
